Sometimes, they pretend they are pirates looking for treasure, and other times, they play hide and seek among the tall flowers. One rainy day, Mary and Joe found a shiny stone and decided it was a magic gem. They took turns hiding it and giggling when the other one found it. All the other animals watched and cheered for them. At the end of the day, Mary and Joe cuddled under the tree and listened to the gentle sound of raindrops, feeling happy to have such a wonderful friend.

Then, Kate the rabbit hopped by and asked, "Can I play too?" Soon, all three friends were laughing and chasing butterflies in the sunshine.

Let’s go see what we can find!"So off they went, jumping over flowers and skipping along a winding path. They found a sparkling pond, and Ann dipped her paw in the cool water. Tom giggled, "Ann, your whiskers look so funny when they get wet!" Suddenly, they heard a friendly "Quack, quack!" It was Sue the duck, flapping her wings and splashing happily.

They leapt over puddles, skipped over stones, and laughed all the way.

He peeked out and saw that Sue was still counting. Just then, Bob the dog came trotting by. "What are you playing?" asked Bob."Hide-and-seek!" whispered Jack. So, Bob quietly joined Jack behind the bush, trying not to giggle.When Sue finished counting, she looked all around. She found Bob first, because his tail was wagging.
